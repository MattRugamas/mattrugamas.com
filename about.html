<h1>I'm <strong>Matt Rugamas</strong>:</h1>
<section class="aboutMe">
  <!-- <p class="about-me">I'm just another student pursuing Computer Science at Santa Monica College from the suburbs of Los Angeles, California. I'm also currently doing Technical Support full-time for a leading global Edtech company.<br /><br />Currently I spend a lot of time on the web side working with SCSS/HTML/Java(script), as well as on the academic side using C++/Ruby/Python. I have a strong interest in Open Source softwares and the part we all play in making the web a better place. All the code for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/MattRugamas/mattrugamas.com">here</a>. In the past I've <a href="http://www.shamancult.bandcamp.com/">played</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0XhHuLBBIY&feature=youtu.be">music</a>, but these days I play just for the fun of it.<br /><br />With this site I aim to write about the various concepts and techniques I'm learning as a way to enforce material in my mind, and maybe help others who are in the same places I am.</p> -->

    <p class="about-me">a fellow human being based not too far from Los Angeles, California.</p>
    
    <p class="about-me">I'm 29 years old and I've been working with technology for over a decade. In the past I've supported web apps like content management systems and help desks, built/maintained/redesigned accessible websites and built/repaired many personal computers. I'm currently a Senior Support Engineer at Atlassian working on JSM Chat as Halp winds down.</p>

    <!-- <p class="about-me">With this site I aim to share, whether a lot or a little, and open up about my learning process. Unfortunately I dabble in music and am linking some stuff below.</p> -->
