<h1>My name is <span>Matthew Rugamas</span>.</h1>
<div id="about-me">
  <p class="about-me">I'm just another student pursuing Computer Science at <a href="http://www.mtsac.edu/">Mt. SAC</a> from the suburbs of Los Angeles, California. Apart from learning about data structures, algorithms and object-oriented programming languages, lately I've taken a liking to Jekyll, GitHub Pages and Travis CI as I develop my first working static siteâ€”the one you're reading now. I have a strong belief in Open Source and the part we all play in making the web a better place. All the code/assets for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/samagurtam/samagurtam.github.io">here</a>. In the past I've <a href="http://www.shamancult.bandcamp.com/">played</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0XhHuLBBIY&feature=youtu.be">music</a>.</p>
