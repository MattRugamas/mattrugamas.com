	<h1>My name is <span>Matthew Rugamas</span>.</h1>
	<p>I'm a student currently pursuing Computer Science at <a href="http://www.mtsac.edu/">Mt. SAC</a>. I develop websites, small web apps, and school projects in HTML, (S)CSS, and Python. I also have experience with C++, Java, and Assembly. Currently, I'm tackling Ruby, Python, Liquid HTML, and frameworks like Flask and Jekyll. I have a strong belief in Open Source and the part we all play in making the web a better place. All the code/assets for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/samagurtam/samagurtam.github.io">here</a>. In the past I've <a href="http://www.shamancult.bandcamp.com/">played</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0XhHuLBBIY&feature=youtu.be">music</a>.</p>
