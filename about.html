<h1>My name is <span>Matthew Rugamas</span>.</h1>
<div id="about-me">
  <p class="about-me">I'm just another student pursuing Computer Science at Santa Monica College from the suburbs of Los Angeles, California. I'm also currently doing Technical Support full-time for a leading global Edtech company.<br /><br />Currently I spend a lot of time on the web side working with SCSS/HTML/Java(script), as well as on the academic side using C++/Ruby/Python. I have a strong interest in Open Source softwares and the part we all play in making the web a better place. All the code for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/MattRugamas/mattrugamas.com">here</a>. In the past I've <a href="http://www.shamancult.bandcamp.com/">played</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0XhHuLBBIY&feature=youtu.be">music</a>, but these days I play just for the fun of it.<br /><br />With this site I aim to write about the various concepts and techniques I'm learning as a way to enforce material in my mind, and maybe help others who are in the same places I am.</p>
