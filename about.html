<h1>My name is <span>Matthew Rugamas</span>.</h1>
<div id="about-me">
  <p class="about-me">I'm just another student pursuing Computer Science at Santa Monica College from the suburbs of Los Angeles, California. I'm also currently doing Technical Support full-time at <a href="www.edlio.com/">Edlio</a>. Apart from learning about data structures, algorithms and object-oriented programming languages, lately I've taken a liking to Jekyll, GitHub Pages and Travis CI as I develop my first working static siteâ€”the one you're reading now. I have a strong interest in Open Source softwares and the part we all play in making the web a better place. All the code/assets for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/MattRugamas/mattrugamas.com">here</a>. In the past I've <a href="http://www.shamancult.bandcamp.com/">played</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0XhHuLBBIY&feature=youtu.be">music</a>.</p>
