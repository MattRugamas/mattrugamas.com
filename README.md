# MattRugamas.com [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MattRugamas/mattrugamas.com.svg?branch=release)](https://travis-ci.org/MattRugamas/mattrugamas.com)

A personal site to begin diving into the web again. Built on a Jekyll/Travis CI/GitHub Pages workflow, styled with SCSS, and layed out with Liquid HTML. Travis CI is the most recent addition and will allow me to play with plugins and gems that aren't on GH Pages whitelist by building the site for me, and pushing the output files to this GH Pages repo for serving as a static site.

## Current Plugins

- [Jekyll-Tidy](https://github.com/apsislabs/jekyll-tidy)
- [Jekyll-Figure](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/jekyll-figure)
- [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net)

## Goals

- Theme Picker (Changes colors of the site)
- Dynamic nav
- 'Projects' page
