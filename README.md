This is the beginning of my personal site, which I feel I will keep hosted on GH Pages for the time being. It is built on Jekyll, leaving me time to just focus on static designs and content.

The idea is to have this page as a home for personal/academic projects, along with posts to dial in exactly what we're working on. It's a journey for all of us, and the destination doesn't matter. Shout out Geohotz. Hopefully some of this turns out helpful for you!
