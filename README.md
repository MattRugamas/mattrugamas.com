# samagurtam.github.io

A personal site to begin diving into the web again. Built on Jekyll with the github-pages gem, styled with SCSS, and layed out with Liquid HTML. I'm leaving the repo public in case anyone else starting up needs to look at some basic, simple source for reference. That would've helped me a lot! As I get the theme of the site down I'll try to make an actual jekyll theme gem.
