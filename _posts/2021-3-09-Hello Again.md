title: Hello Again

It's been a while! A lot of relatively sudden change in my little bubble caused inactivity on the ol' blog, but I'm slowly gearing back up to blog about technical topics and the like.

Something that has taken up a big portion of my focus in the last year has been Accessibility, of web elements and content specifically, but also in a broader sense. I aim to start sharing my introductions to the topic and some of the interesting in-depth, under the hood stuff that has piqued my interest. I've also spent a good amount of hours fiddling through the complexities of CSS FlexBox and CSS Grid as they provide rigid tooling for layouts and positioning of web elements. All of this to say that good stuff should be coming soon to this very locationâ€”if you like the web in that way, of course.

I also wanted to start opening up the blog to other things besides the web, ideally it would help channel some energy into things I want to get back into like playing and recording music, starting another PC build, etcetera.

I'm back on SoundCloud doing the thing, here's [a newly-uploaded track that came from a random Logic session during a late night](https://soundcloud.com/samagurtam/mk00). ([https://soundcloud.com/samagurtam/mk00](https://soundcloud.com/samagurtam/mk00))
