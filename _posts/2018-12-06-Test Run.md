title: Test Run
---
I've finally started to get projects up and running thanks to GitHub and frameworks that make deploying a site or web app easy.

My goal is to keep projects consistent and keep a log of them here. I have a couple posts in the works as to how I got this site up and running in totality. There's a lot of helpful guides out there but it took me a while to sort through dated, half-relevant material. I believe these guides will be more straightforward. That's the goal at least ;)

Thanks for sticking around and checking out this site. I know it's a little skeletal right now, but just give your boy a moment to work.
