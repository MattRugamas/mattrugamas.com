Ruby and RubyGems is familiar, I’ve gotten the hang of switching between Ruby environments with rbenv, and I like the idea of packaging Jekyll themes in a RubyGem. With Jekyll we can also style with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sass-lang.com&quot;&gt;SCSS&lt;/a&gt;, write posts in &lt;a href=&quot;https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; (kramdown), and do kinda-dynamic stuff using HTML with &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.github.io/liquid/&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt;—sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s site tutorial&lt;/a&gt; has many useful components built in that we’re going to keep. The blog component is very simple, and since we’re going to be writing, that stays over. There’s no staff and separate blog page on this site, So we’re going to remove the ‘authors’ collection and the whole ‘collection’ functionality until it is needed. The blog component can be easily migrated to the home page by getting familiar with &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.github.io/liquid/&quot;&gt;Liquid’s Syntax&lt;/a&gt;. Liquid makes our posts available as static html pages that we can cycle through a format with HTML. We’re also going to set up a base layout that all other layouts are derived from in our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layouts&lt;/code&gt; folder. Our index layout inherits from this, as well as our post layout. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://realfavicongenerator.net&quot;&gt;set up a favicon package&lt;/a&gt; to support a wide-range of devices and put the package in it’s own include in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_include&lt;/code&gt; folder. The navigation set up is also in an include, as well as a bit of Liquid HTML that sets up the page titles. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/&quot;&gt;Necolas’ reset&lt;/a&gt; and started with plain HTML. I built up my own SCSS in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.scss&lt;/code&gt; and imported &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;main.scss&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reset.scss&lt;/code&gt; into styles.scss, which is where the page loads it’s styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/samagurtam/pen/oQOwOv&quot;&gt;navigation bar style&lt;/a&gt; that I forked from user &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/shahjehan/pen/BzLKRm&quot;&gt;shahjehan&lt;/a&gt; over on &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/shahjehan/&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;. I took the animation he was using in one of the nav styles and modified it to match the barebones minimal style I wanted to approach for the site. I also needed something simple that I could style and scale gracefully to smaller viewports. Much of this project turned out to be learning CSS, SCSS and how they work. Jekyll made the site building process much simpler such that I only really needed to focus on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/DirectoryLayout.png&quot; alt=&quot;DirectoryLayout&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re hosting on Github Pages because a) it’s free, and b) works well with Jekyll. Pros and cons of course, one being that &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/versions/&quot;&gt;Github Pages has a whitelist&lt;/a&gt; on dependencies/plugins such that we are forced to use Jekyll 3.7.4 along with other not quite up-to-date wares (With Jekyll we need to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec&lt;/code&gt; command as a prefix before any jekyll commands if we’re running a newer Jekyll than the one GitHub currently has whitelisted). A pro on the other hand is that we don’t build! We push our commits over to our remote repo on GitHub and they build our site and serve, meaning we can add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; directory to our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;. We can start this process by using GitHub’s web interface to create a new repo titled &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt; and pushing our updates to the master branch of this new repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s basically it. I’m looking forward now to learning a bit about &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org&quot;&gt;React JS&lt;/a&gt; and re-implementing this site in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org&quot;&gt;GatsbyJS&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like we’re going to need fundamental familiarity with vanilla JavaScript… Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Jekyll feels like a great place to start, again.

&lt;p&gt;So coming into 2018 my conceptions of web tooling, and programming languages (think what we’re doing with modern JS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/en/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://parceljs.org&quot;&gt;Bundlers&lt;/a&gt;, etc), needed refreshing. All of these relatively new technologies I had previously heard a thing or two about on dev twitter, but I never really looked into any of them or how they worked. I knew I wanted to use a static page generator but I knew I’d have to come to grips with more fundamental tooling first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/terminal-with-configs.png&quot; alt=&quot;terminal-with-configs&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)&quot;&gt;Terminal.app&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s terminal emulator for MacOS and is enough for what I needed: Getting Started. I’ve heard great things about other emulators like &lt;a href=&quot;https://iterm2.com&quot;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hyper.is&quot;&gt;Hyper&lt;/a&gt;, but I feel having a solid foundation on a default terminal emu is beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was the bourne again shell, or BASH (As opposed to, say, &lt;a href=&quot;http://zsh.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;ZSH&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ohmyz.sh&quot;&gt;Oh-My-ZSH&lt;/a&gt;, etc). Because of licensing issues, MacOS ships with a slightly outdated version of Bash. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; to install a more current version of Bash, and then dove into Bash specifics, commands, and configuration files. &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypepat.com/2016/two-shells-one-prompt.html&quot;&gt;Pat’s write up&lt;/a&gt; on this helped me out a lot so instead of reinventing that wheel, I’ll just link to his excellent write up. He also has some posts on Jekyll and virtualenv that helped me set up this site and get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; project started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learn Bash, package managers, running scripts and programs via Bash, and soon we’re installing Jekyll through RubyGems and starting a new Jekyll project on the Desktop using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new&lt;/code&gt;. Sweet. (I also installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv&quot;&gt;rbenv&lt;/a&gt; to instal the latest Ruby build, installed the latest bundler, etc) This first couple of days was spent wrapping my head around fundamental tooling: Terminal emus, shell environments, package managers, dependencies, &lt;strong&gt;Git&lt;/strong&gt;, text editors (I settled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://macromates.com&quot;&gt;Textmate 2&lt;/a&gt; for now..) Jekyll installation, setup, and Jekyll’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/&quot;&gt;awesome tutorial project&lt;/a&gt;. That’s really enough resources to get in the door. We’re interested now. Wouldn’t it be cool to build a static page site and maybe get it hosted somewhere? I hear Github Pages is doing some hosting…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My experience with web tools fell exponentially after high school, when computer science courses intrigued me with ‘actual’ programming languages like C++ and Java, with a little Python mixed in with discrete math curriculum.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Test Run</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Test-Run" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Test Run" /><published>2018-12-06T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-12-06T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Test%20Run</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Test-Run">&lt;p&gt;I’ve finally started to get projects up and running thanks to GitHub and frameworks that make deploying a site or web app easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to keep projects consistent and keep a log of them here. I have a couple posts in the works as to how I got this site up and running in totality. There’s a lot of helpful guides out there but it took me a while to sort through dated, half-relevant material. I believe these guides will be more straightforward. That’s the goal at least ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sticking around and checking out this site. I know it’s a little skeletal right now, but just give your boy a moment to work.&lt;/p&gt;
